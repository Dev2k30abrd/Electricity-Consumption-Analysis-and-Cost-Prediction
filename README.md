# Electricity Consumption Analysis and Cost Prediction
Python-based application to analyze electricity consumption and cost


## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes electricity consumption based on appliance usage and estimates the electricity cost. 
It helps users understand appliance-wise energy usage and identify high energy-consuming devices.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Calculate appliance-wise electricity consumption
- Estimate electricity cost based on usage
- Compare multiple appliances
- Visualize electricity consumption using graphs
- Promote energy-efficient practices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ⚙️ How It Works
- User enters appliance details such as power rating, usage hours, number of days, and tariff
- The system calculates electricity consumption in kWh
- Total electricity cost is estimated
- Results are displayed in tabular and graphical form

## 📊 Output
- Appliance-wise electricity consumption
- Total electricity cost
- Graphical comparison of appliances

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
